# Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of through manual processes.

With IaC, configuration files are created that contain our infrastructure specifications, which makes it easier to edit and distribute configurations. It also ensures that we provision the same environment every time.

## Configuration Management

Configuration management refers to the process by which all environments hosting software are configured and maintained. It is the process of maintaining systems, such as computer hardware and software, in a desired state. Configuration Management (CM) is also a method of ensuring that systems perform in a manner consistent with expectations over time.
