# Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of through manual processes.

With IaC, configuration files are created that contain our infrastructure specifications, which makes it easier to edit and distribute configurations. It also ensures that we provision the same environment every time.
